Hello! I am a PhD student in the Graduate Group in Ecology and the designated emphasis in Environmental Humanities. My research blends the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities to investigate the impacts of climate change on forest disturbance. I am particularly curious about how disturbance regimes are being altered due to settler colonial management strategies and changes in climate patterns, how these disturbance regimes are interacting with each other within forest ecosystems, and how these factors are transforming forest community composition and ecosystem function. My work with FOCAL uses deep machine learning methods to scale up forest data collection from field plot to landscape by combining historic and contemporary field, drone, and satellite data.
